# Dr Liv

Dr Liv is a small children's game about working in a hospital or primary care facility.

1. The patient arrives (looking ill).
2. The doctor (you) gathers the symptoms.
3. After diagnosis the doctor administers different remedies depending on the ailment.
4. If correct remedy, the patient gets better and the doctor can see the next patient.
